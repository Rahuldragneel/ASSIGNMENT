            Basic learning<br>

            I had a little knowledge about HTML which made my learning experience in classes more fun and  a lot easier. I was interested in computer since I was a very child and learning about it always seems fun to me no matter what. Since I was 15 I started learning HTML. But joining the classes made me realize whatever I knew before was far more than not enough. This encouraged me more to learn about it even more. Although I had learned basics of HTML I still was still a beginner for CSS. Learning CSS was a little difficult for me as I was not so familiar with its basics. But over time I learned it and I became more and more familiar with it. Which made me realize it was not as hard as I thought it was.  I did exercises provided along with the slides which help me gain some self confidence and made me more interested to learn CSS. This assignment has also helped me a lot in checking on my progress in both HTML and CSS. It helped me learn new things as I was searching for new tags and was wanting to make the designs I had in my mind.    
            Hence, this course has helped me challenge my self more and check my skills and learnt a lot of things I never knew even existed. It was very exciting for me to learn new things and will be looking forward to learning more things in the future.
